Challenge Response(s) for Ventera Challenge -- Richard G. Dews
1) Answers, to the Challenge questions and requirements, are in-line within the modified original Word Postgis Database Engineer Challenge.docx within this repository.
2) SQL statements are provided in the Richard Dews - Ventera Coding Challenge SQL Statements.sql file, also within this repository.
3) The PostgreSQL 15 DB, containing the uploaded Lidar data and subsequent tables (per the Challenge Requirements), is also backed up and placed within this repository as a set of tar files (57 of them); a) I performed the following command, to dump the database to a file: pg_dump -U postgres postgres > "C:\Users\Richard\Downloads\Richard_Dews PG_Challenge_Dump"; b) I then used 7zip to tar/split this backup file (DB) into 57 10MB pieces, under the nomenclature Richard_Dews PG_Challenge_Dump.tar.xxx (where xxx represents 001 through 057). In order to restore this DB to your PostgreSQL host, perform pg_restore -d postgres Richard_Dews PG_Challenge_Dump (after using 7zip to recombine the 57 tar pieces described above).
4) The original USGS Lidar LAZ file, i.	USGS Lidar Point Cloud NC_Phase5_2018_A18 LA_37_00964920_.laz, has been added to this repository via: a) 7zip to nomenclature USGS_LPC_NC_Phase5_2018_A18_LA_37_00964920_.tar.xxx (where xxx represents 001 through 020)
